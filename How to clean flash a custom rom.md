# How to clean flash a custom rom

## Drivers

- First of all i use the following method related to drivers.
https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/official-tool-windows-adb-fastboot-and-drivers-15-seconds-adb-installer-v1-4-3.2588979/

- I download this first: https://forum.xda-developers.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=4623157&d=1540039037

- Then to avoid any issues with my device not being found in fastboot mode i do this: https://forum.xda-developers.com/attachments/howto_driver-zip.2480396/

- And then i download the latest adb drivers: https://dl.google.com/android/repository/platform-tools-latest-windows.zip
On this folder is where i do all my adb/fastboot stuff. I just open a CMD window on this folder and execute everything here to avoid any problems.
